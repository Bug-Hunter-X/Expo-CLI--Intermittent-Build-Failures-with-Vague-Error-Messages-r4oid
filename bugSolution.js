After extensive debugging, the problem appeared to be linked to a combination of factors:

1. **Native Module Conflicts:**  Inconsistent behavior during the linking of native modules.  The solution involved verifying that all native modules were correctly installed and configured.  Using the Expo Go app, running `expo prebuild` or upgrading to latest expo and native modules versions solved this conflict.
2. **Caching Issues:**  Sometimes, Expo's caching mechanisms would retain problematic states. Clearing the Expo cache using `expo start --clear` consistently improved build stability.
3. **Asynchronous Operations:**  The application had asynchronous operations which, in some builds, resulted in race conditions.  Ensuring proper error handling and using async/await or Promises resolved the majority of these issues.

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how these solutions were implemented in the code.  Further investigation into the Expo CLI's build process may reveal more details about the root cause. Note that this solution may not work in all cases; reporting this bug to the Expo community or investigating thoroughly the build process might be required.
