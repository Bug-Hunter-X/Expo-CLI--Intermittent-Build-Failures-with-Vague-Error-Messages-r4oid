While developing a React Native application using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error during the build process. The error message was vague and didn't pinpoint the exact cause.  The build would fail intermittently, sometimes succeeding on subsequent attempts. The error message would sometimes include references to native modules or unexpected behavior during the bundling phase. Code that worked perfectly previously started producing this error without any code modifications. This behavior was inconsistent across different development machines and Expo SDK versions.
